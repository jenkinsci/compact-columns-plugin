<div>
This column allows you to more flexibly configure the Job Name column.  Options include
<br/><br/>
<b>Color job name for the latest build</b> - Colors the job name itself with the color that represents the status of the last build.  In this case, this column could (for example) be a reasonable replacement for the status ball column.
<br/>
<b>Show description in tool-tip</b> - When you hover over the job name, if there is a job description, it will show in the tool-tip.
<br/>
<b>Show last build status in tool-tip</b> - When you hover over the job name, a summary of the last build status will show in the tool-tip.
<br/>
<b>Note</b> - you can select both of these options, and it will show both the job description and the last build's status in the tooltip.
<br/>
<b>Colorblind hints</b> - Color-coding can cause accessibility concerns.  Choose a colorblind hints option if this will be useful to you.  Only applies if you chose to color the job name.
